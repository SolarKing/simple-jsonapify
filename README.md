A simple node.js module to help generate and parse json as per the
[JSON API Spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/).

*Quick Note*: This is my first open-source project that I am publishing
into the wild. Please feel free to enforce the "survival of the fittest"
mantra - the more you judge, the more powerful I become! But seriously,
please feel free to point out any coding mishaps,
[submit issues](https://github.com/SolarKing/simple-jsonapify/issues),
and/or toss in any suggestions. :)
